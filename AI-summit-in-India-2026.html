            <p>Inside the gleaming, fortified halls of the Bharat Mandapam, Google’s Sundar Pichai is shaking hands with India’s Prime Minister. Outside, millions of Indians are wondering if the AI boom will mean a better life—or the end of their job in the IT sector. This is the central tension of the AI Impact Summit 2026, a five-day gathering that is part tech-expo, part diplomatic battleground, and entirely India’s bid to prove that the future of intelligence cannot be written in code alone—it must be written in the context of a billion people.</p>
            
            <h2>India Takes Center Stage: The AI Impact Summit 2026 Kicks Off in New Delhi</h2>
            <p>NEW DELHI – In a historic moment for the Global South, the AI Impact Summit 2026 officially opened its doors in New Delhi on Monday, marking the first time a major global conference on artificial intelligence is being hosted by a developing nation. The five-day summit, which runs from February 16 to 20 at the sprawling Bharat Mandapam convention center, has drawn unprecedented global participation, with over 20 heads of state, 60 ministerial delegations from 45 countries, and 500 global AI leaders converging in the Indian capital .

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the signature India AI Impact Expo, setting the stage for a summit driven by the theme of inclusive and responsible AI . The event is being framed not merely as a conference but as a national statement of intent. Union Minister Jitin Prasada aptly described the gathering as a "Mahakumbh for artificial intelligence," emphasizing the historic scale and India's ambition to transition "from being users of AI to becoming creators of AI" </p>
            
            <h3>A Summit for the Global South</h3>
            <p>The choice of New Delhi as the venue is a deliberate and significant one. After previous summits in the UK (Bletchley Park), South Korea (Seoul), and France (Paris), the baton has now passed to a nation representing the interests and aspirations of the Global South . The Indian government is positioning itself as a crucial bridge, aiming to ensure that the future of AI is shaped not just by the tech giants of the West and China, but also by the needs of the developing world.

Prime Minister Modi took to social media platform X to underscore the event's importance, stating it "proves India's rapidly growing prowess in science and technology" . The official objectives are ambitious: to "strengthen global partnerships" and "establish India's dominance in the AI sector over the next ten years" </p>
            
            <h2>Star Power and Notable Absences</h2>
            <p>The attendee list reads like a who's who of the tech world. Confirmed speakers include Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon . They are joined by political leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, both of whom are scheduled for bilateral talks with PM Modi . United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres is also expected to participate in the deliberations .

However, one notable figure is missing. AI chip giant NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang reportedly canceled his appearance due to unforeseen circumstances . His absence is a minor setback, given the critical role of NVIDIA's hardware in powering the current AI revolution.</p>
